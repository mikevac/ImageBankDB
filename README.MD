# Image Bank Database

## A Repository for DDL

This is an initial repository for the data definition files for the ImageBank Demo Application.  

## Goals

The files contained within will be migrated to Liquibase in a future release.  In the meantime the scripts to create and update the ImageBank database are kept in the scripts directory.
